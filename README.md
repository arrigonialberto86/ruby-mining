ruby-mining
===========
The primary goal is to develop a framework in which the functionalities taken from different sources (e.g. Weka, Apache.Commons.Math) will be made available to the Ruby language through some ad-hoc APIs designed with Jruby.

The rationale of this project is to complement the existing SciRuby data mining softwares with some other well-established Java softwares (Weka predominantly). These would cover aspects of scientific computing which don't have full Ruby support yet.

Moreover, a modular framework design would provide extensibility features which people willing to contribute may be eager to use. Regarding this aspect, it would be subsequently possible to extend our framework to include other computing softwares (such as Waffles).
